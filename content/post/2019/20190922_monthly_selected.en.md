## Miscellaneous

A busy and boring week, nothing worth mentioning.

{{< gallery album="misc" >}}

There are cat cages outside the pet store.
Without Eva, I have to feel some cats every time I pass by.

{{< gallery album="cat" >}}

I go to the Starbucks at the Shenye Uphill mall during weekend sometimes,
just sitting there and watching outside.
If I arrive at Lunch time I can get the best spot,
where I can see young people taking pictures outside.

## About Butters

Almost no time to exercise, I eat health as best as I can.

{{< gallery album="butters_cooking" >}}

I get some new craps.
