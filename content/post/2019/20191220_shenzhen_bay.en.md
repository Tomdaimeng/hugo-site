I organized a hiking event around the Shenzhen bay for our department.
In the end 6 people join in.

The plan was 16 kilometers, and the starting point at the Mangrove Natural Reserve near the Futian custom.
But when we arrive we realize by "Reserve" it means seriously reserved.
The area is closed to tourists.
So we enter the sea side walkway near the end of the Mangrove Reserve.
Along our walk we keep facing the setting sun.
When we finish, it is full dark, and the total mileage is over 10 kilometers.

## Tourists

There are a lot of people on the walkway, tourists, runners, couples and others.
It gets more and more crowded as we approach the subway station.
But afterwards the walkway becomes emptier, maybe because it is getter dark.

## Animals

You can see the outcome of recent effort in the environment protection by the government.
Flocks of seagulls and ducks gather around the shore.
Proabably they come for the food mostly.
Sometimes I can see fishes jumping out of the water.
