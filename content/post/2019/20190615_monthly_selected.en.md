## People

{{< gallery album="people" >}}

Kids in Shenzhen, or at least in the suburb area, live a happy childhood.
They remind me of the childhood of our generation.
These days in Beijing, it's hard to see any kids without one or more protective guardians close by.
The kids here just play and skate on the street after school.
There are shout and laughter until later than 10 pm.
The boys can roll around on the ground without being scolded.

{{< gallery album="kids" >}}

## Plants

The plants and animals (especially insects) are large in the south,
even though the people tend to be skinny.
Most of the plants in the classic poems seem to be from the south.
Northerners can hardly relate.
I don't know if the southerners have different feeling when reading about
the plants they see everyday in a classic poem.

{{< gallery album="plant" >}}

## Animals

I'm most impressed by the giant snail.
I never thought wild snails can be this big.
All the snails in Beijing are tiny.

{{< gallery album="animal" >}}

There is some kind of cat show or competition in the mall.
I don't like this kind of events.
Every cat is unique.
To rank them by some standards demonstrates our arrogance as human beings.
There is barely no meowing noise at all at an event full of cats.
They may be sedated.
The cat in the temple lives a more comfortable life,
resting just like the reclining Buddha statue in the hall.

{{< gallery album="cat" >}}

## Things

I notice a Banruochansi Temple (Prajna Zen Temple) nearby in the map.
To keep the tradition of visiting temples I go and have a look.
It's newly and nicely built by the Gallaxy Group on its property.
The pipal trees and buddhist pines in the temple are fully grown,
likely bought somewhere and transplanted here.
This temple reminds me of those I saw in Japan.
This is probably the first temple I visit in China that has nothing to do with tourism.
All the visiters are people living or working nearby.
In the weekend there are people in lay Buddhist clothes reading scriptures.
The people who help cleaning the yards in the morning are likely some volunteers.

Walking through the village buildings in Wuhe in just as interesting as
watching the prosperity of Nanshan and Futian.

## About Butters

As my daily routine gets settled, I once again start the plan of losing weight.
I gradually change my schedule.
I go for a 3 km run of the mountain path in 6:30 am, which takes about 40 minutes.
It takes some time to get used to and makes me very sleepy in the afternoon.
But I feel the day becomes much longer than before.

{{< gallery album="butters" >}}

I cannot stand living without any plants.
I pick up some twigs falling from the tree after a storm,
and also trim some plants by the roads.
In the end only the purple leaves survive.
