Selected photos taken in May 2019.
I come back to Shenyang in the beginning of the month.
Eva still knows me.
As I settled down, I buy some new decoration and plants.
I try to run the mountain in the morning and eat homemade lunch whenever possible.
I hope those can work.
I visit Shenzhen University during weekend.
It is a beautiful campus, which could have been a nice place to run if I lived nearby.

## Shenyang in May

I come back to Shenyang in the beginning of May.
Just as Shenzhen is ready for the summer season,
the land in Shenyang is still in color or dirt.
Getting off the plane, you can tell the experienced traveller by them putting on Canada Goose coats.
The airport staff also wear down coats.

In the world of the Game of Thrones, it's a remarkable achievement
for a northerner coming back from the south alive.

{{< gallery album="sy_in_may" >}}

## Eva

Eva still recognizes me. She doesn't go hide when she see me.
She has more chicken liver and shrimps in Shenyang than she did in Beijing.
Yet she doesn't gain any weight.
As always she still dislikes the White.

{{< gallery album="eva" >}}

## Shenzhen University

I visit Shenzhen University in a weekend.
I expected mostly modern buildings in a relatively newly built university.
But the campus looks old and simple.
The trees by the street are full of huge jackfruits.
The staff have to climb the tree and fasten them by wires,
otherwise they will fall down and hurt passing pedestrians.
The botanic garden is delicate but doesn't stand out in the campus,
because the whole campus looks like a botanic garden.

{{< gallery album="szu_plant" >}}

A lot of birds live in the Wenshan Lake.
There is a wooden shed in the water for the ducks,
whose roof is made in solar panels.
Maybe ducks like hot showers too.
Someone is walking a rabbit in the lawn,
getting all the attention of the kids.

{{< gallery album="szu_animal" >}}

## Art Gallery

There is an art gallery of "national styles" in the first floor of the Galaxy World building.
I finally check it out in a weekend.
There are two ongoing exhibits: Sculpture of TENG Wenjin and K'o-ssu of GU Jiandong.

The bronze statue of Mr. Deng is made by a team led by TENG Wenjin.
This is an interesting exhibit.
Every work has a description written by the artist.
His theme and style are closely related to the real life.

K'o-ssu (Ke Si) is a type of tapestry
to weave with fine silks and gold thread.
Differently from embroidery, each side of the work shows the mirror image of the other.
Each work has a note stating its name and time to finish,
most of which take between 10 to 20 years.
This kind of art work doesn't tolerate any error:
one mistake results in a restart from the very beginning.

{{< gallery album="exibition" >}}

## The Window of the World

All people tell me there is nothing to see in the Window of the World.
I still need to at least visit once to know how boring it is,
even though I am almost certain that I'll regret it.

In my memory I had a blast at the World Park in Beijing when I was a kid.
Maybe the duplicates in the World Park were better,
or maybe I was too young to realize it is pointless to squeeze the world in a park.
I want to know what the African brothers feel about those plastic pyramids.
A vine grows around the buildings of Manhattan, which looks like the post apocalypse world.
I wanted to take a fake tourist photo in front of the Notre Dame,
but I'm afraid I may look like a Godzilla in Paris.

## About Butters

### Maneki Neko

I am happy to own a Maneki Neko,
and to see its two giant brothers.

{{< gallery album="maneki_neko" >}}

### Butters' Morning Run

Lately I try to get up early and run in the mountain park,
around the Yabao reservoir.
The milage is less than 4 km but the mountain path really tests my cardio.
Sometimes I go to the temple after the run.
I never see the cat there in the morning.

{{< gallery album="morning_run" >}}

### Butters' Food

To cut down the calorie intake, I start to bring homemade lunch.
It is tasteless because of lack of oil and salt, but good enough for me.
I develop a craving for guava recently.
I cannot help myself to buy four of them whenever I go to supermarkets.
Once I forget to eat them they will clog my fridge.

{{< gallery album="butters_cooking" >}}

### Butters' Plants

I tried to domesticate some wild plants and failed,
so I decide to buy some like normal people do.
I don't know why the landlord install the wine bottle shelf,
but I am going to grow a plant wall on it.

{{< gallery album="butters_plant" >}}

### Butters' Craps

Attracted by the cat theme, I buy the book of "I Am a Cat", the tote bag and a sake set.
When I checkout, the clerk reminds me that
"The book is different than the pop fictions;
it is full of implicit philosophy and needs slow reading.
And the sake set can be used as a vase."
Apparently I look like a person who doesn't drink.

I also manage to hang the tenuguis out.

Some friends wish me "happy birthday" in group chats.
Never turn down others' good will,
so I light a candle to celebrate.

{{< gallery album="butters_crap" >}}

### Butters' Bad Taste

Even though it has been an old joke,
but the speech videos of Jack Ma still attract lots of people in the airport bookstore.
I know every character on the banner, but still read it wrong.
