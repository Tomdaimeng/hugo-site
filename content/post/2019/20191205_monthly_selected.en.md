## From the Plane

I have a round flight between Shenzhen and Shenyang during the National Day holidays.
On the plane I can see the familiar northern autumn land.
I see the Guangzhou Tower on the flight back to Shenzhen.

{{< gallery album="flight" >}}

The aircrew hand out little national flags to each passenger.

## Eva and the White

Eva still knows me because she doesn't hide away.
The careful look on her face reminds me the very first time I met her.
The White is still happy as a careless boy.

## Animals

A pet stuff stand pops up in the mall.

{{< gallery album="petstore" >}}

I capture two cockroaches using the plastic can.
While I try to capture the third one, one of the two escapes.
I am so angry (afraid) that I kill all three of them.
