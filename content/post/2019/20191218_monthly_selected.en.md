## Plush Bear

The prize of a company event.
This one is still unclaimed and lying on the first floor sofa.

{{< gallery album="bear" >}}

## Double Eleven

I have lost any urge to shop and too lazy to jump around for a 5 yuan coupon.
But in the end I still fall for it.

{{< gallery album="1111" >}}

## Lunchbox

The supermarket has abalones for 4 yuan each,
so I have abalones for lunch.
As a northerner, I cannot resist the temptation of corns
and have a drawer of them in the fridge.
After boiling some, a little worm climbs out of one of them.
And this particular corn tastes better than the others.

## Meilin Mountain

Undefined and I planned for the Tanglang mountain as the weekend climbing.
We enter the mountain at the Meilin mountain trail entrance,
reach the Meilin mountain peak "the Giant Skull",
climb down to the Meilin reservoir and leave for home.
Because to finish the whole route it may take the whole day,
which is way pass our preparation.

## Qiniang Mountain

We rent a car and drive to the Qiniang mountain in the weekend.
A little bit shorter than the Wutong mountain,
yet the climb is tough enough.
You can still see a crater out of the peak.
The Dapeng peninsula is surrounded by sea in three sides,
and the view on the peak is awesome.

From wikipedia:

> Qiniangshan is a mountain in Nan'ao Subdistrict, Dapeng Peninsula.
> At 869 metres above sea level, it is the second tallest mountain in Shenzhen after Wutongshan.
> It is located within the Dapeng National Geopark.

It is formed by volcano eruption in the Yanshan movement.
