I had a half day tour in Hangzhou West Lake before my interview.
The weather was hazy.
There were few touriests,
but I met many groups of square dancers.

I walked along the Bai Causeway,
and each passing building are historical.

There is an exhibition on Leifeng Pagoda in a small building
in Zhejiang Museum.

A lot of huge squirrels ran on top of the trees.
People brought nuts to feed them.
I also met four half-grown kittens.
