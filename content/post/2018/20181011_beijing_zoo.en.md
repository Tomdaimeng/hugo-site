The main target of the trip to Beijing Zoo is the Panda House.

Pandas have a particular way of eating bamboo leaves:
first they strip the leaves from the bamboo using their mouths;
their mouths slowly become full of leaves;
then they pick up the leaves and roll them up usint their paws;
they enjoy the green roll in the end, like a spring roll.

Sleeping pandas.

One panda is very active, chasing a ball around.

A panda wonders around the entrance near the closing time,
which is the same as people lose their focus near the end of the day.

Big cats, is like the exact zoom in of small cats,
they have the same movement and expressions.
