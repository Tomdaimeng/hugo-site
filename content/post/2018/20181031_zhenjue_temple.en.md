I have visited here once in a winter, and missed the prime gingko season.
I came here in the end of this October, but seemed to be still a little
early for the fully golden color.
Then I came back again on a Wednesday (free admission) for the guided
tour.

Frankly I am not sure what is the current proper name of this place.
During Ming dynasty this is called "Zhenjue" temple,
on the board above the gate it writes
"Imperical Built Jingang Baozuo Pagoda",
and the time stamp is
"Da Ming Chenghua Ninth Year Eleventh Month Second Day" (1473).
The Qing government rebuilt the temple, and renamed it "Zhengjue" temple
to avoid the name of emperor Yongzheng.
Someone says this is the same location as the Huguo Renwang temple of
Yuan dynasty, but it cannot be confirmed.

The other buildings of the temple has disappeared into history,
while only the pagoda and two gingko trees are still standing.
If the trees were transplanted in Ming dynasty when here was firstly
completed, then they are more than 500 years old.

Now this place belongs to Beijing Stone Carving Art Museum,
there are tablets and stone statues in the courtyard,
also collected stone art in the building.
Most exhibits here are original.

Emperor Qianlong wrote four poems in the ceremony of
rebuilding of the Imperial Academy (Hanlin Yuan).
The tablets were located exam hall (Gong Yuan) afterwards and
replicated all around the country,
which became a symbol of good fortune for exam takers.

A yellow and white cat was sitting inside the glass door of office area.
It kept meowing to call someone to open the door,
because it wanted to walk around.
I saw a few cats last time, but only this one this time.
However there are a few cat houses along the building wall.

Besides real cats, there are a lot of stone cats.

The tour guide was very thorough;
the tour took nearly two hours.
