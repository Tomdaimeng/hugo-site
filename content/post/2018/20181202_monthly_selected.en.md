There are fewer pictures for this month.

I got sick in the beginning of this month.
I felt weak that afternoon, and started to burn up after going to bed.
I tried to sleep through the night,
but I was half conscious and half asleep the whole time,
with my head going through all kinds of weird stuff.
At some point I thought it must be almost morning,
it turned out to be 1 am.
Afraid of never getting up again,
I found the thermometer and some possibly expired medicine.

Near the end of the month,
I had a wisdom tooth pulled out,
and have another one scheduled for two weeks later.
The hammering made my head hurt.
I could hear something ripping apart when the tooth finally let go.
I wanted to keep the tooth but the doctor rejected that.
So I only had a photo to memorize.

Five days after the fever,
I finally got out for lunch and some slow walking.
The autumn was almost over,
but the yellow leaves in the park nearby was still lovely.
However, it took a slight breeze to knock down layers of leaves.
There was a wutong (Chinese parasol) tree,
whose color reminded me some oil painting.

Mr. Wu brought me back from Japan a twister egg.
Inside it was a figurine of Zoro.
I put it on top of the shelf on my desk.

I bought an iron cast teapot during 11-11 impulsively.
I never knew there were so much trouble.
Firstly I had to "open" it by boiling tea for three times.
To avoid rusting I had to use it regularly and
to clean it right afterwards.
However it did encourage me to drink more water
and to clean more often.

Even suffering from illness,
I still managed to capture a couple people.

One day I was suprised by a large chunk of nail
in the scratching mat.
It was normal to find some tiny layers,
but I've never seen such a large one.
I examined Eva's paw and it was that bad finger nail of hers.
She must have pulled it off while playing too hard.

As long as there was something on the bed,
Eva would lie inside it.
Her hair became too long,
it exploded after she took a nap.

I went through the storage boxes to find medicine.
As I put things back afterwards, I cleared a box.
Eva was very interested in the box,
but apparently it couldn't fit her inside.

Eva's new favorite spot: on the shelf of the desk.
As a studying companion, she was either sleeping
or licking herself.
