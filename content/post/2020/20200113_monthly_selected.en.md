## Animals

I walk through a quiet alley,
and find a cat sleeping in an empty birdbath planter
and another sleeping on the wall.
I cannot resist to pet it and it doesn't even wake up.

{{< gallery album="evilhand" >}}

There are two small dogs living around the guards' house.
The guards sometimes will lead them into the park for a walk.
This one is looking down the slope and seemingly waiting for someone this morning.

{{< gallery album="yabaodog" >}}

Some other animals photos.

## People

Behind the scenes of the street photographers in Uphill Mall.
I like to bring my camera and shoot pictures of them the same as
how they shoot passing people.
I wonder what their reaction will be if treated the same way as they treat their targets,
chasing ahead of them and taking photos.

{{< gallery album="photographer" >}}

However, I don't have any moral high ground as a hidden photographer.

## About Butters

Eva, White and my new phone case.

{{< gallery album="butters" >}}

I love this alley, the yards are quiet but open to the street.
I find a perfectly color changing leaf during my morning climb.

{{< gallery album="misc" >}}

Once again I spot a worm in the corn.
This time it gets chopped half way, and shows a white meaty cross section.

{{< gallery album="food" >}}

When the fate sends me a hint, I have to chop it up.
