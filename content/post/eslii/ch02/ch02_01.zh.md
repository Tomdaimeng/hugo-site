第一章中提到的前三个例子有一些共有的构成元素。每个例子中都有一组已知或固定的、可视为输入的变量。这些变量对一个或多个输出结果产生影响。每个例子的目标多是用输入的变量来预测输出的变量的值。这种问题被称为*有监督学习*。
以上我们用到了现代机器学习的术语。在统计学领域中，*输入变量*通常被称为*预测变量*，或更经典的文献中会称为*自变量*，在本书中这三个术语的意义相同。另外在模式识别领域中，更倾向于称之为*特征*。输出变量被称为*responses*，经典文献中也称为*因变量*。


The first three examples described in Chapter 1 have several components
in common. For each there is a set of variables that might be denoted as
inputs, which are measured or preset. These have some influence on one or
more outputs. For each example the goal is to use the inputs to predict the
values of the outputs. This exercise is called supervised learning.

We have used the more modern language of machine learning. In the
statistical literature the inputs are often called the predictors, a term we
will use interchangeably with inputs, and more classically the independent
variables. In the pattern recognition literature the term features is preferred,
which we use as well. The outputs are called the responses, or classically
the dependent variables.
