线性回归模型假设回归方程$E(Y|X)$是输入参数$X\_1 ,\cdots , X\_p$的线性组合。

A linear regression model assumes that the regression function $E(Y|X)$ is
linear in the inputs $X\_1 ,\cdots , X\_p$ . Linear models were largely developed in
the precomputer age of statistics, but even in today’s computer era there
are still good reasons to study and use them. They are simple and often
provide an adequate and interpretable description of how the inputs affect
the output. For prediction purposes they can sometimes outperform fancier
nonlinear models, especially in situations with small numbers of training
cases, low signal-to-noise ratio or sparse data. Finally, linear methods can be
applied to transformations of the inputs and this considerably expands their
scope. These generalizations are sometimes called basis-function methods,
and are discussed in Chapter 5.

In this chapter we describe linear methods for regression, while in the
next chapter we discuss linear methods for classification. On some topics we
go into considerable detail, as it is our firm belief that an understanding
of linear methods is essential for understanding nonlinear ones. In fact,
many nonlinear techniques are direct generalizations of the linear methods
discussed here.
