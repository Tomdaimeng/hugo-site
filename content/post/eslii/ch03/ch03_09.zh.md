Least squares fitting is usually done via the Cholesky decomposition of
the matrix X T X or a QR decomposition of X. With N observations and p
features, the Cholesky decomposition requires p 3 +N p 2 /2 operations, while
the QR decomposition requires N p 2 operations. Depending on the relative
size of N and p, the Cholesky can sometimes be faster; on the other hand,
it can be less numerically stable (Lawson and Hansen, 1974). Computation
of the lasso via the LAR algorithm has the same order of computation as
a least squares fit.
