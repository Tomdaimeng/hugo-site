In this chapter we describe generalizations of linear decision boundaries
for classification. Optimal separating hyperplanes are introduced in Chap-
ter 4 for the case when two classes are linearly separable. Here we cover
extensions to the nonseparable case, where the classes overlap. These tech-
niques are then generalized to what is known as the support vector machine,
which produces nonlinear boundaries by constructing a linear boundary in
a large, transformed version of the feature space. The second set of methods
generalize Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The generalizations
include flexible discriminant analysis which facilitates construction of non-
linear boundaries in a manner very similar to the support vector machines,
penalized discriminant analysis for problems such as signal and image clas-
sification where the large number of features are highly correlated, and
mixture discriminant analysis for irregularly shaped classes.
