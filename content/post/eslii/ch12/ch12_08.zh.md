With N training cases, p predictors, and m support vectors, the support
vector machine requires m 3 + mN + mpN operations, assuming m ≈ N .
They do not scale well with N , although computational shortcuts are avail-
able (Platt, 1999). Since these are evolving rapidly, the reader is urged to
search the web for the latest technology.

LDA requires N p 2 + p 3 operations, as does PDA. The complexity of
FDA depends on the regression method used. Many techniques are linear
in N , such as additive models and MARS. General splines and kernel-based
regression methods will typically require N 3 operations.

Software is available for fitting FDA, PDA and MDA models in the R
package mda, which is also available in S-PLUS.
