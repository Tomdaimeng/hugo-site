In this chapter we begin our discussion of some specific methods for super-
vised learning. These techniques each assume a (different) structured form
for the unknown regression function, and by doing so they finesse the curse
of dimensionality. Of course, they pay the possible price of misspecifying
the model, and so in each case there is a tradeoff that has to be made. They
take off where Chapters 3–6 left off. We describe five related techniques:
generalized additive models, trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines,
the patient rule induction method, and hierarchical mixtures of experts.
