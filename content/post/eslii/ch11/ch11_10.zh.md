With N observations, p predictors, M hidden units and L training epochs, a
neural network fit typically requires O(N pM L) operations. There are many
packages available for fitting neural networks, probably many more than
exist for mainstream statistical methods. Because the available software
varies widely in quality, and the learning problem for neural networks is
sensitive to issues such as input scaling, such software should be carefully
chosen and tested.
