In this chapter we describe a class of learning methods that was developed
separately in different fields—statistics and artificial intelligence—based
on essentially identical models. The central idea is to extract linear com-
binations of the inputs as derived features, and then model the target as
a nonlinear function of these features. The result is a powerful learning
method, with widespread applications in many fields. We first discuss the
projection pursuit model, which evolved in the domain of semiparamet-
ric statistics and smoothing. The rest of the chapter is devoted to neural
network models.
