For most of this book, the fitting (learning) of models has been achieved by
minimizing a sum of squares for regression, or by minimizing cross-entropy
for classification. In fact, both of these minimizations are instances of the
maximum likelihood approach to fitting.

In this chapter we provide a general exposition of the maximum likeli-
hood approach, as well as the Bayesian method for inference. The boot-
strap, introduced in Chapter 7, is discussed in this context, and its relation
to maximum likelihood and Bayes is described. Finally, we present some
related techniques for model averaging and improvement, including com-
mittee methods, bagging, stacking and bumping.
