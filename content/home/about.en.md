## Welcome...

...to my new website! Congratulation to be one of the five visitors of
this month.

I rewrote the site with hugo. It does look fancier, but I
still miss the plain look of the old site.

Recently I'm reading
[*The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd edition*](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/),
And I transalte and add notes to the chapters along the way.
Here's the [table of content](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/),
which will take you to the chinese site.
